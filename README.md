# STV Web
This project contains STV web interface.

## UI development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This mode is intended for UI development purposes only. **stv-server** is not available in this mode and therefore no server-side computations are available.
## Build and full development server

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

In this mode **stv-server** is available (it has to be started separately). Use `ng build --watch` to enable automatic rebuild on source code changes.
